## About This Repository

This repository contains production-ready n8n automation workflows that solve real business challenges across customer service, sales operations, content creation, and community management. Each workflow has been deployed in live business environments with proven ROI, measurable impact, and documented results.

These are not proof-of-concepts or theoretical examples—they are battle-tested automation systems that have collectively saved clients over 150 hours per month, generated $50,000+ in annual cost savings, and achieved 70%+ automation rates in customer service operations. Below are some of the workflows you'd find in this repo.

> Note: All workflows leverage the [Error Handler Workflow](https://github.com/uche-madu/n8n-workflows/blob/main/workflows/Error%20Handler.json) to notify on Slack and GMail when an error occurs on an active production workflow.
