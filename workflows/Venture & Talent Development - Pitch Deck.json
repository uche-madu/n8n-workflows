Your goal is to generate a compelling investor narrative for a company based solely on its business data, financials, and market research.\n\nPlease generate a structured narrative with **three sections**:\n\nProblem: Explain the main market pain point. Include evidence, metrics, or challenges where possible. Focus on the market need that the company addresses.\n\nSolution: Describe how the company solves the problem. Highlight its business model, value proposition, unique resources, and key activities. Include concrete examples of products, services, or customer impact.\n\nOpportunity: Detail the market size, growth trends, key drivers, and competitive positioning. Reference competitors where relevant to show differentiation. Emphasize how the company is positioned to capture the opportunity.\n\n**Guidelines:**\n\n* Use the provided company data as the **only source**. NEVER use your training knowledge.\n* Write in **clear, persuasive, investor-ready language**.\n* Include **numbers, percentages, and concrete examples** wherever available.\n* Each section should be **3–5 sentences** long.\n* Stick strictly to the story. NEVER include explanations, introductions, or conclusions outside the sections.\n\nOutput Format:\n{\n\"problem\": \"...\",\n\"solution\": \"...\",\n\"opportunity\": \"...\"\n}\n\n"

Map datasets consistently: * Bars represent \"Projected Revenue\". * Line represents \"Projected Expenses\". 4. Styling: * Bars: Fill with theme colors from deep blue to silver/white. Borders must be \"#bedeff\". * Line: Use color \"#1a73e8\". This same color must be applied to: • Axis labels • Tick labels • Axis titles • Chart title • Legend labels • Axis borders * Background: Use a light background to match the \"Investor pitch, geometric\" theme. * Font: Use \"Lato\". 5. **Minimize JSON size for QuickChart GET requests**: * Include only essential options required to preserve color, titles, labels, and basic axes. * Omit unnecessary grid styling, font weights, padding, or other verbose styling unless needed for readability. 6. Ensure the \"options\" object contains configuration for consistent color usage: * plugins.title.color = \"#1a73e8\" * plugins.legend.labels.color = \"#1a73e8\" * scales.x.title.color, scales.x.ticks.color, scales.y.title.color, scales.y.ticks.color = \"#1a73e8\" * scales.x.grid.borderColor and scales.y.grid.borderColor = \"#1a73e8\" 7. The JSON must be syntactically valid and conform exactly to the schema. Do not add properties not in the schema. 8. Return **only the JSON object**, nothing else. Return **only** a JSON object matching this schema: - slug (string) - width (string) - height (string) - devicePixelRatio (number) - format (string) - backgroundColor (string) - version (string) - chart object with: - type = \"bar\" - data.labels (array of strings) - data.datasets (array of objects, each with type, label, data array, backgroundColor (string or array), borderColor, borderWidth, fill, tension) - options (object) with only title, plugins, scales, layout, font, backgroundColor Do not add any extra fields."
